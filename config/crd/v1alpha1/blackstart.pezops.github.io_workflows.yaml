                        DoesNotExist is a special parameter that can be used to indicate that the resource should
                        not exist. This is useful for resources that are changed from a previous state and now
                        should be deleted if they still exist.

                        the `fromDependency` property. The `fromDependency` must contain both an `id` and `output`
                        property to indicate which operation and output value to use as a dynamic input value that
                        is filled at runtime.

                        should be replaced. This is useful for resources that always must be updated so that
                        attributes / output values are known by blackstart. This should not be configured by users,
                        and should only be used explicitly by modules.
